PLEASE READ THIS:

This folder is where you should put your images.

1.  **Profile Photo**:
    -   Put your photo here: `public/images/profile.jpg` (or .png, just make sure the name matches the code).
    -   Currently the code looks for: `/images/profile.jpg`

2.  **Projects**:
    -   Put your project screenshots in the `projects` folder.
    -   Example: `public/images/projects/project-1.jpg`
    -   Update the file `components/sections/Projects.tsx` with the correct filenames if yours are different.

3.  **Certificates**:
    -   Put your certificates in `certificates` folder if needed.
